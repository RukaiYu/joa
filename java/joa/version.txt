JOA Version History

1.0.4.0 2018-12-18

- DDAddin 2.1.0, support copy/paste mail item from clipboard.

- ITJ-75, do not try to load debugging DLLs.

1.0.3.0 2017-06-08

- Fixed JoaDll.activateDisabledAddin which ensures that the add-in is added to the list of 
  Outlook\Resiliency\DoNotDisableAddinList. 

1.0.2.0 

- If used with JOA, read license key from specified sub-key given by 
  DDAddinDll.setProductName(). 

- Loads DDAddin for D&D of mails and attachments into an Add-in.

0.9.0 2015-12-01

- Annotation processor could cause errors in some environments:
  e.g. "MyAddin mus extend class com.wilutions.joa.outlook.OutlookFormRegion".
  Removed additional plausibility checks that caused the problem.

- Enhanced load time. Do not wait for JoaUtil to be loaded.

- NPE in native DLL when Registry keys for Addin registration were missed.

- More log statements on level FINE

0.7.0 2015-05-15

- New LoadBehavior.LoadByJoaUtil. Addins registered under this load behavior are
  loaded by the JOA Util Addin and not by Outlook. In this case, Outlook does not
  track the startup time of the Addin and does not disable it, if the load time
  is long. 

0.5.0

- GH#2 Addin was ignored by Outlook, if application's command line 
  (LocalServer32 entry) was too long. Now, create a BAT file to start the 
  application if the command line is longer than 250 characters.

- GH#3 Registry class did not read/write java.util.List correctly

- Do not focus the Java frame window after creation anymore. If the Java frame is 
  e.g. shown in a FormRegion of a new appointment form, the focus should start as
  usually in the subject line and not in the FormRegion.

0.4.0 2014-12-05

- Swing components can be integrated with JOA. Exception: JMenuBar cannot be used.

- View classes for JavaFX content were renamed and moved to package com.wilutions.joa.fx:
  TaskPaneFX, FolderViewFX, FormRegionFX, ModalDialogFX.
  
- Renamed the joa-with-dlls.jar to joa.jar. This should make it less likely to mix it up
  with joa-without-dlls.jar.
  
- Previous versions did not run on 32bit Windows.
